            Hellooo!(⁠θ⁠‿⁠θ⁠)




  













              
























True love will guide you to trust the rhythm of your life
showing you that everything happens for a reason.
It will teach you the courage to open your heart again,
even after experiencing pain.
It will remind you that you are worthy of love, 
and that you are never too much for anyone.
