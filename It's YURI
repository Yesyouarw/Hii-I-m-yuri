What if you fall for someone and they leave? 
What if you place your heart in the hands of someone else
And they do not want to hold it? 
What if they do not love you back?
 But what if they do?

What if you take the chance, 
what if you risk your heart, 
what if you crash it into someone 
who genuinely inspires you
and they choose you?

What if they love you
the way you always desired to be loved? 

What if they make you breakfast in bed on Sundays
And hug your broken pieces back together,
and bring you soup when you're sick
and fill your life with the sunniest,
most tender kind of happiness?
What if they grow you, 
and encourage you,
and teach you that love was always meant to be soft? 
That it was always meant to feel 
the way it feels when you are with them?
What if they make you understand why it never worked out with anyone who came before them?
What if they stay?








Do not be afraid to try for something.(⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)
