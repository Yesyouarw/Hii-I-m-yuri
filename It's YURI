            Hellooo!(⁠θ⁠‿⁠θ⁠)




  













              
























The right love will teach you to trust the timing 
of your life.
It will show you that it was always meant to be.
It will teach you how brave it is to open your heart
to someone even after being hurt.
It will show you that you are worthy of love
and that you were never too much for anyone.

it's like we're talking each other)
