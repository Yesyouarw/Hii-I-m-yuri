            Hello!
           (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠)














              wait...
           Are you okay?...


























When you are not feeling good enough
just try your best to remind yourself 
how far you have come.
Start paying attention to what you are,
rather than what you aren't. 
Start paying attention to the things you have,
rather than the things you don't.
Remind yourself that you are someone's 
favorite human being.

        I need to say bye now 
        you'll be okay!♥️

























(I'm gonna update this every Saturday so
