You know, I was just reading 
something the other day that really struck me. 
It's a quote by Jimmy Johnson
"The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra."
It's so simple, but it's so true. 
it's not about being some superhuman talent, 
it's about those small, consistent efforts that add up. 
that extra push on a project and
that extra bit of kindness to someone:)
It's all about those little extras that make the difference ʘ⁠‿⁠ʘ

it's like we're talking each other)
